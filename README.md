This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps 
npm run dev
then add new terminnal
run cd my-shope/shope
npm run dev 
to start database sanity

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
